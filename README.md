# BBCBacklightController
An extremely simple CLI-Based Xbacklight Controller 


I made this because i3config wouldn't let me use my XF86 multimedia buttons. 

If you have the same problem, you're in luck. Or, you could just use a better program like one of the multiple GBacklights.

I made this because i just wanted to open a terminal and type some stuff, press some keys. No GUI, and thus no mouse required.
