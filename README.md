# ShellSBR
Some incredibly simple programs to control sound and backlight. 
Stands for Shell Sound & Backlight Replacement.

I made these because i3config wouldn't let me use my XF86 multimedia buttons. It's sort of an interim replacement.

**Update:** So i figured out what I did wrong. Turns out, you're supposed to edit the config file in `~/.config/i3`, not the one in `/etc/i3`. Oh well, these'll stay here anyways.

If you have the same problem, you're in luck. Or, you could find some better, more intuitive alternatives.

I also made these because i just wanted to open a terminal and type some stuff, press some keys. No GUI, and thus no mouse required.
