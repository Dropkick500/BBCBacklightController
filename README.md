# ShellSBR
Some extremely simple programs to control sound and backlight
Stands for Shell Sound & Backlight Replacement.

I made these because i3config wouldn't let me use my XF86 multimedia buttons. It's sort of an interim replacement.

If you have the same problem, you're in luck. Or, you could find some better, more intuitive alternatives.

I also made these because i just wanted to open a terminal and type some stuff, press some keys. No GUI, and thus no mouse required.
